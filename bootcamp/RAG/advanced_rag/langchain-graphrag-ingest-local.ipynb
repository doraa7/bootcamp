Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Short-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\"\n",

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 1.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Self-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 2.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: To avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 5.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: In comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Short-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Sensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)​ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: They did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\"\n",

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: HuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\"\n",

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: The AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\", task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text, \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}].

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: (2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: With the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: (4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Level-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call.

Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: The LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: One interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: They also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Each element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Planning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 13. The generative agent architecture.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Constraints:\\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.\\n2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.\\n3. No user assistance\\n4. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. \\\"command name\\\"\\n5. Use subprocesses for commands that will not terminate within a few minutes\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Commands:\\n1. Google Search: \\\"google\\\", args: \\\"input\\\": \\\"<search>\\\"\\n2.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: 9. Read file: \\\"read_file\\\", args: \\\"file\\\": \\\"<file>\\\"\\n10. Append to file: \\\"append_to_file\\\", args: \\\"file\\\": \\\"<file>\\\", \\\"text\\\": \\\"<text>\\\"\\n11. Delete file: \\\"delete_file\\\", args: \\\"file\\\": \\\"<file>\\\"\\n12. Search Files: \\\"search_files\\\", args: \\\"directory\\\": \\\"<directory>\\\"\\n13. Analyze Code: \\\"analyze_code\\\", args: \\\"code\\\": \\\"<full_code_string>\\\"\\n14.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: 18. Send Tweet: \\\"send_tweet\\\", args: \\\"text\\\": \\\"<text>\\\"\\n19. Do Nothing: \\\"do_nothing\\\", args:\\n20.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Resources:\\n1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.\\n2. Long Term memory management.\\n3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.\\n4. File output.\\n\\nPerformance Evaluation:\\n1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.\\n2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.\\n3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.\\n4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: You should only respond in JSON format as described below\\nResponse Format:\\n{\\n    \\\"thoughts\\\": {\\n        \\\"text\\\": \\\"thought\\\",\\n        \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"reasoning\\\",\\n        \\\"plan\\\": \\\"- short bulleted\\\\n- list that conveys\\\\n- long-term plan\\\",\\n        \\\"criticism\\\": \\\"constructive self-criticism\\\",\\n        \\\"speak\\\": \\\"thoughts summary to say to user\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"command\\\": {\\n        \\\"name\\\": \\\"command name\\\",\\n        \\\"args\\\": {\\n            \\\"arg name\\\": \\\"value\\\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\nEnsure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: GPT-Engineer is another project to create a whole repository of code given a task specified in natural language.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: \\\"content\\\": \\\"Summary of areas that need clarification:\\\\n1.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: },\\n  {\\n    \\\"role\\\": \\\"assistant\\\",\\n    \\\"content\\\": \\\"Remaining unclear areas: 2 remaining questions.\\\\nCan you provide more information about how the MVC components are split into separate files?\\\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\",\\n    \\\"content\\\": \\\"{{Make your own assumptions and state them explicitly before starting}}\\\"\\n  }\\n]\\nThen after these clarification, the agent moved into the code writing mode with a different system message.\\nSystem message:\"\n",

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: You will get instructions for code to write.\\nYou will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.\\nMake sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.\\nThink step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.\\nYou will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.\\nThen you will output the content of each file including ALL code.\\nEach file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that\\nFILENAME is the lowercase file name including the file extension,\\nLANG is the markup code block language for the code’s language, and CODE is the code:\\nFILENAME\\nCODE\\nYou will start with the “entrypoint” file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.\\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.\\nEnsure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.\\nInclude module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.\\nBefore you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.\\nUseful to know:\\nYou almost always put different classes in different files.\\nFor Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.\\nFor NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.\\nYou always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.\\nYou try to add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.\\nYou always follow the best practices for the requested languages in terms of describing the code written as a defined\\npackage/project.\\nPython toolbelt preferences:\"\n",

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: \\\"content\\\": \\\"You will get instructions for code to write.\\\\nYou will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.\\\\nMake sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.\\\\n\\\\nThink step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.\\\\nYou will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.\\\\n\\\\nThen you will output the content of each file including ALL code.\\\\nEach file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that\\\\nFILENAME is the lowercase file name including the file extension,\\\\nLANG is the markup code block language for the code's language, and CODE is the code:\\\\n\\\\nFILENAME\\\\n```LANG\\\\nCODE\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou will start with the \\\\\\\"entrypoint\\\\\\\" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so\"\n",

Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs.

Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: },\\n #  … same conversation as earlier, ended with \\\"Make your own assumptions and state them explicitly before starting\\\".\\n  {\\n    \\\"role\\\": \\\"assistant\\\",\\n    \\\"content\\\": \\\"Assumptions:\\\\n1. Model: The model will contain the game's data, such as level information, character states, and enemy positions.\\\\n2. View: The view will handle the game's visuals, including rendering the game objects, backgrounds, and updating the display.\\\\n3.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: code in different files are compatible with each other.\\\\nBefore you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.\\\\n\\\"\"\n",

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: }\\n]\\nChallenges#\\nAfter going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to see a couple common limitations:\"\n",

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Finite context length: The restricted context capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions, API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Weng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”. Lil’Log. https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/.\"\n",
