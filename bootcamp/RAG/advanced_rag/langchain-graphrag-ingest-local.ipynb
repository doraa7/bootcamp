Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Short-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\"\n",

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 1.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Self-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop).

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Chain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: To avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 5.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: In comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \\\"dark\\\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Short-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Sensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)​ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: They did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: HuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Fig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: The AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\", task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text, \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}].

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: (2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: With the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}.
